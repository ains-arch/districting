For Pennsylvania, runs a random walk to create two histograms: one showing the number of Republican
districts according to votes in the 2016 Presidential election
`histogram-presidential-republicans-clean.jpg`, and one showing the number of Republican districts
according to the 2016 Senate election `histogram-senate-republicans-clean.jpg`. Runs the Markov
chain for 100 steps, but that can be increased as desired.
